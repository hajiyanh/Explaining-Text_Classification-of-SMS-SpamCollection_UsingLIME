# Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation for Text-Classification
## SMS Spam Collection Dataset

This project focused on different classifiers on the SMS Spam collection dataset. 
Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bidirectional RNN were developed on this dataset. Then, a Local explanation tool called LIME was applied to decisions made by each classifier and interpreted the results.
